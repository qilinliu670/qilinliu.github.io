# Technical Meetup One-Page Review

Write a one-page (double-spaced!) review of a technical Meetup presentation related to testing, software quality assurance, etc. It would be best if you could actually attend a local Meetup and write up your review based on the presentation there. But if you prefer, you can write the review about a past Meetup, a recording of which has been posted; this is the case for many of them.

If you aren't familiar with [Meetup.com](http://meetup.com/), I heartily recommend that you register and search for local Meetups related to your career interests.

If you aren't familiar with formal reviews (of books, films, music, technical products, etc.), I heartily recommend that you read several reviews before you start writing your own review.

Your reviews will be graded based on:

A concise summary of the presentation's content, including its title
Inclusion of the date of the presentation
Inclusion of the name of the speaker and a sentence or two about him or her
Your opinions of the presentation's content and delivery, along with the basis of those opinions
An absence of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. You are allowed and even ***encouraged*** to review each other's review (redundancy intended!) in order to submit as good a review as possible. You are also encouraged to read your presentation out loud and **slowly** in order to "hear" as many errors as possible. **WARNING**: Your instructor is very intolerant of writing errors! So, do your best to make as few of them as possible!
