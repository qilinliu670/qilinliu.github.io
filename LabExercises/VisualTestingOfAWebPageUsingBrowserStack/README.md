# Lab Exercise: Visual Testing of a Web Page Using BrowserStack's Screenshots

Create a free trial account on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/). Use the **Screenshots** feature to check a page from any of our testing sites on a variety of platforms. Inspect the individual screenshots to look for bugs. If you find a problem, try reproducing it using the **BrowserStack Live** feature. If the bug is reproducible in **Live**, then file a **Bugzilla** report about it (assuming one doesn't already exist!).

To submit your assignment, convert your **BrowserStack Live** results to a .pdf file and upload it via **Catalyst**.
