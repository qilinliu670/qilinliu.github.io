# Lab Exercise: Using a Link Checker to Find Broken Links

Use a link-checker such as the [W3C Link Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink) or [Dead Link Checker](http://www.deadlinkchecker.com/) to look for broken links in some (small!) portion of the De Anza web site; even one "busy" page is enough. The output from a link-checker can be difficult to understand. File a bug for any reported problem that you can both understand and manually reproduce.

To submit your assignment, create a .pdf file of the report page displayed in your browser and submit the .pdf. Nothing else need be submitted to complete this exercise.
