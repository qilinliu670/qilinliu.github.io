# Lab Exercise: Crowdtesting via RainforestQA

This week's lab exercise is a foray into **Crowdtesting** (also called **Crowd-Sourced Testing**) using RainforestQA. Here's what you need to do for the exercise:

* Sign up for their [Free Trial](http://info.rainforestqa.com/trial).
> Enter **De Anza College** into the **Company** field.
> Enter **QA Student** into the **Job Title** field.
* Create a single test case (NSHSF, De Anza, or ResumeSmarts--your choice), complete with steps and questions. 
> Note that RainforestQA requires a question (**EXPECTED RESULT** equivalent) for each step. To work around this oddity, I entered a blank question for each step which did not require any check afterward.
> Note also that the free trial will not allow one to set up a different site than the default airbnb.com. To work around this oddity, I made step-1 of my test case be an instruction to navigate to the proper URL.
* Take a snapshot of your completed test case. Here's mine for a ResumeSmarts test case involving a leading blank in the **Email** field when logging in.
* Do a **Preview** of your test case. RainforestQA will pop up a window with a VM (Virtual Machine) of the platform you select for the Preview.
* Start executing your test case in that VM.
* Take an image of the VM midway through your execution.
Creating the test case will give you a tiny flavor of what it's like to be on the test developer end of RainforestQA. You'll be playing the role of a QA engineer/customer of RainforestQA.
Executing the test case will give you a tiny flavor of what it's like to be a paid **crowd tester** for RainforestQA, executing test cases from a variety of their customers.
To submit the assignment, upload your two images files.
