# Bug Reporting via Bugzilla

You will be finding and reporting bugs via Bugzilla throughout the first half of this course. To submit bugs for grading, you must copy/paste the URL needed for me to easily view your five ***best*** bugs.

Your grade for this work will be based on:

* Quantity (-20 for every missing bug if fewer than 5 are submitted)
* Completeness (every relevant field should be utilized)
* Ease of reproducibility (I should be able to easily reproduce each bug, assuming it's still in existence. If it's not still in existence, the bug should be in state **RESOLVED/FIXED**.)
* Originality (No earlier submissions of the same bug should exist in our Bugzilla installation.)
* Lack of errors (Misspellings, garbled sentences, sloppy formatting, etc., will all cause a loss in points.)
