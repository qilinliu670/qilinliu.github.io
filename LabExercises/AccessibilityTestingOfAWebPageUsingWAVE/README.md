# Lab Exercise: Accessibility Testing of a Web Page Using WAVE Assignment

Use a web accessibility checker to test any one of our three test sites you wish. You may use [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/), the tool I demo'ed in class on 04/25, or another of your choosing. If you choose a tool other than WAVE, make sure that you're testing only a single page or very small subset of the site. If you find what you think is an accessibility bug in an "owned" page, file it via Bugzilla.

There is a lot to know about web accessibility issues, so I recommend that you focus on missing alt values initially. But I encourage you to read more about Accessibility and experiment with accessibility checker tools as much as possible!

To submit this lab exercise, upload a .pdf of the report you received from the web accessibility checker you used.
